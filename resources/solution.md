# Solution

> I should create a class to represent the robot.

# Moviment

The moviment depends of each side the robot is facing. So I must create a var to store side and the current x and y of robot. and check for moviment conditions like : if robot is facing north and I say "M" them the robot shoul move in Y direction

# Turn

To turn I must get the current side that the robot is facing and mode according with the side graus.

# Example

If robot is facing north and the first command is to turn Left the robot should face East.


# Grid

The robot should execute moviment greater them his grid.
